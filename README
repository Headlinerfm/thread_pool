A simple executor-style ThreadPool for Ruby (with tests, yay!)

Usage:

	require "rubygems"
	require "thread_pool"
	pool = ThreadPool.new(threads = 10)
	pool.execute { puts "I'm writing from a thread" }
	pool.join
	
It's often useful to make sure that the properties of Ruby's blocks don't bite you.  The following code will usually print three nils, because n keeps changing.

	pool = ThreadPool.new(threads = 10)
	numbers = [1, 2, 3]
	while n = numbers.shift
		pool.execute { puts n.inspect }
	end
	pool.join
	
Passing arguments to execute avoids this. i.e.:

	pool = ThreadPool.new(threads = 10)
	numbers = [1, 2, 3]
	while n = numbers.shift
		pool.execute(n) {|local| puts local.inspect }
	end
	pool.join
